# CSE228Project
Andrew and Omkar's CSE228 Final Project
## Prerequisites
Make sure you have sbt installed on the machine you are planning to use.\
If you haven't installed it before, follow the directions from this [link](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html)
## Getting Started
Clone the repo to your machine, and run the following commands in order:
1. `cd CSE228Project`
2. `sbt`
3. `compile`
## Things that work:
1. Complex Multiplier and Tester
2. Butterfly Unit and Tester
3. Twiddle Factor ROM and Tester
4. Bit Reverse model (for use to test the AGU)
## Work in progress:
1. Address Generation Unit
2. Memory
3. Filters
4. Forward and Inverse FFT blocks (or singular butterfly units, depending on multipliers specified)


After following these steps you will have compiled the project
## Current Status
We are in the early development stages of this project. So far we have been able to complete working on the butterfly unit, twiddle factor LUT and bit reversal components in our FFT design.
